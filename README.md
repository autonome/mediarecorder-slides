# `MediaRecorder` slides

Slides for presenting about [MediaRecorder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder_API) and other APIs that play nicely with the `MediaCapture` API

Open the index.html file in a browser and you can see things.

Start a local server with https and you can see things without having to allow all the prompts to use the camera for the demos. [Here's how you can get a working local https server](https://certsimple.com/blog/localhost-ssl-fix). Then go to https://localhost:8080/ and enjoy the slides!

I also keep a more or less up to date version of the slides [online](https://soledadpenades.com/files/t/2016_rtalchemy/).
